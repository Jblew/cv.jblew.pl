    <h2><time>2018</time> - <time>2019</time> — Architect and developer of wise at wise-team.io</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stack:</strong> 
      Steem blockchain + Typescript/Node.js/browser + Vue.js + Docker/swarm + PostgreSQL/PostgREST + Redis/socket.io +
      Hashicorp Vault + Travis + Ansible + Logz.io
    </p>
    <p>
      Wise-team.io (https://github.com/wise-team) was a blockchain startup. We run a Steem (now Hive) blockchain witness node
      and maintained two decentralized apps for Steem blockchain: Engrave and Wise. I was the architect and lead of the WISE
      system. Wise was a platform that allowed “whale” users to delegate their voting power under strictly defined and
      publicly visible criteria. We designed a 2nd layer blockchain protocol with a toolset: a nodejs library, a cli tool, and
      a web portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Learned:</strong>
      secure development where client money is at stake • TDD • secure CI/CD • cryptographic key management (using Hashicorp
      Vault) • managing open-source project and collaborating with the community (PRs, issues) • hosting public • presenting
      project at a conferences (Steem Meetup Warsaw, Steemfest 2018)
    </p>

    <h2><time>2019</time> - <time>today</time> — Personalized patient advice system for Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka (Non-profit)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stack:</strong>
      Firebase (Functions/Firestore/RealtimeDB/Auth/DynamicLinks/Hosting) + Typescript/Node.js/browser + Vue.js + Android
      native + Google Play store + Travis
    </p>
    <p>
      I was asked to develop the system by doctors in Allergology Ward of the Voivodeship Children Rehabilitation Hospital in
      Ameryka. It was aimed to help with two issues: (1) allergic test have long evaluation time and the results arrive after
      patient discharge; (2) the advice is often complicated and hard to remember by the patient. This app allows patient’s
      parents to view medical advices on their mobile devices. This is a non-profit and open source (GPLv3) project:

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Learned:</strong>
      providing training for and users and IT support staff • GDPR compliance
    </p>

    <h2><time>2019</time> - <time>2021</time> — Hi.pine gamified cheneau bracing (Non-profit)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stack:</strong>
      Typescript, Vue, React, Google IoT platform, GCP datastore, ESP32, Platform.io, Markovian+Bayesian ML
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheneau is an effective means to treat juvenile scoliosis but the difficulty lies in the fact that an adolescent has to
      wear the rigid brace 23 hours a day. I was asked to develop a device to monitor therapy compliance and angle
      progression. In a multidisciplinary team we designed several prototypes of a device to be mounted on Cheneau braces.
      During the development of the project we decided that gamification will be more effective than plain control of
      compliance. To elevate my skills on gamification I completed a month-long Behavioural Design Masterclass by Yu- kai Chou
      and obtained an Octalysis Level 1 certificate on gamification. The project also facilitated development of near-realtime
      hidden markov classifier for pattern recognition in 3*9dof motion sensors. The project was discontinued due to an
      earlier success of similar solution (we decided that it is better to start designing in another field rather than
      compete with already working solution that embraced core features of our idea).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Learned:</strong>
      secure IoT device management • collaboration with machine-learning expert • preparing data for machine-learning work •
      ML DevOps (data management, model deployment)
    </p>

    <h2><time>2019</time> - <time>2020</time> — Pitchup.com</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stack:</strong>
      Typescript, NodeJS, Vue, Xstate, GraphQL/Hasura, Postgres, Python, Gitlab
    </p>
    <p>
      At Pitchup.com I was consulting Typescript related decisions and issues, building search middleware, designing a proof
      of concept (and later implementing) a novel approach to frontend state management using finite state machines (xstate
      machines as a state provider for vue). I also implemented SQL views and procedures for Hasura GraphQL backend
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Learned:</strong>
      finite state machines • collaboration with UX team and understanding UX research reports • improved English
    </p>

    <h2><time>12.2020</time> - <time>2021</time> — Refair.me</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stack:</strong>
      Typescript, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, Vue, Gitlab, Jira
    </p>
    <p>
      Refair.me was an innovative HR platform for gamified referral-based recruitment. I was a half-time senior fullstack
      developer working on refactoring both backend and frontend to Typescript. The project was discontinued on Feb 2021 due
      to lack of financing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Learned:</strong>
      refactoring large codebase on actively developed project
    </p>

    <h2><time>09.2021</time> - <time>09.2022</time> — Voivodeship Specialist Hospital in Olsztyn</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Wards:</strong>
      Traumatology, Cardiology, Primary Care, Maternity ward (labour tract), Emergency Department, General surgery, Intensive
      care, General Pediatrics, Neonatology, General Psychiatry
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing medical university and passing Polish Medical Licensing Exam I am completing the mangatory physician
      internship. I chose Voivodeship Specialist Hospital in Olsztyn because the hospital is organized around large emergency
      department and holds status of a trauma center which means that there is an opportunity to learn emergency care and gain
      experience in treating common iatrogenic complications that are more often admitted than in most hospitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Learned:</strong>
      teamwork in stressful situations • emergency closed-loop mode communication • working in a highly hierarchical community • 
      professional communication with patients
