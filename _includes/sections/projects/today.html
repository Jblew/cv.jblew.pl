<h4>03.2018-today — Architect and full-stack developer of Wise as wise-team.io</h4>
<p>
    Wise-team.io (https://wise-team.io/) is a blockchain startup. We run a Steem blockchain witness node and maintain two decentralized apps for Steem blockchain: Engrave and Wise. I am the architect and the leading developer of the WISE system. Wise is a platform that allows steem users to delegate their voting power to others under strictly defined and publicly visible criteria. It consists of a common library, a cli tool, a voting webapp, a delegator webapp, public database api, daemon service for non-technical users and a vault server for cryptographic key management. All services run in a self-deployable and self-managing cluster. All packages are open source and published to npmjs.com registry or to Docker cloud. Wise app: https://wise.vote/, the explanation: https://docs.wise.vote/, and the sources: https://github.com/wise-team.

<p>
    I have improved on multiple skills at Wise-team, such as brainstorming and collaborating in a team. I have presented our ideas and the product to the public at the Steemfest conference in autumn 2018. Technical skills mastered at Wise include: Typescript+Javascript full stack, Vue.js, Docker, GIT, continuous integration (Travis CI), continuous deployment (Ansible), TDD.

    Personalized patient advice system for local hospital
</h4>
<p>
The idea behind this project was invented by two doctors on the Allergology Ward of the hospital. Patients and doctors on this ward have to cope with two problems: first — allergic test have long evaluation time and the results arrive at the hospital after patient discharge; second — the advice is often complicated and hard to remember by the patient. I was asked to develop a system that allows patient’s parents to view medical advices on their mobile devices. The advices are created by the doctors in the hospital and then, a deep link to the app is sent to the patient’s parent phone. Whole system uses a serverless approach with database, cloud functions and authentication provided by Firebase. Currently the system consists of a native Android app for parents and an electron based standalone desktop app for medical professionals. iOS app for parents and user management app are due to be done. This is a non-profit and open source (GPLv3) project.
